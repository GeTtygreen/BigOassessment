I think the doublerInsert scales better
The reason why doublerAppend scales better than doublerInsert is because when you append a value into an array using the .push(), it adds it to the end of the array.
the .unshift method, which adds it to the beginning of the array, requiring the rest of the array to shift up an index, which
creates the massive scaling.
